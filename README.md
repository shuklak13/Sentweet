#SentweetSearch is a sentiment analysis application for Twitter data. It may classify tweets as positive or negative.

Run the SentweetSearch.py file from the command line, as follows:

`python SentweetSearch.py`

The app will ask you for a search query. It will then return the 100 most recent public tweets with that keyword, as well as their detected sentiment, and the ratio of positive-to-negative tweets found.
