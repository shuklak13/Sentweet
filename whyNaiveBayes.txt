Faster to train than Maximum Entropy, more accurate than Decision Tree
I believe that the Naive assumption isn't too harmful because tweets are so small (fewer collocations)
	However, this may be wrong
My experience with NLTK's Maximum Entropy and Decision Tree gave me poor results

However, it is possible that Naive Bayes is not the way to go. I will continue to look into other classifiers.
